Mondays ask more questions than they answer. Before the week rushes in, Scripture gives us a posture: **stand**.

> Therefore take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand firm. Stand therefore... (Ephesians 6:13–14)

- Stand firm in grace, not performance.
- Stand with truth buckled on, not opinions.
- Stand because Christ stood for you.

A short prayer: Lord, steady my steps today. Help me stand in Your strength. Amen.
