**Scripture:**

> "For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand."  
> — Ephesians 6:12-13 (NIV)

Men,

This weekend was a grind. I was all over the place—fixing the truck's brakes, raking the last of the leaves, winterizing the house, and sneaking in some work emails to get ahead. Every task got checked off. Glory to Jesus, it was a win. But Monday morning? I'm drained. My tank's on empty, and the thought of this workweek feels like climbing a mountain with a backpack full of bricks. You ever been there? Busting your tail to get it all done, only to feel like you're starting the race already out of breath?

That's where I'm at today. And if you're feeling it too, let's talk about the real fight. It's not just the to-do list or the Monday grind. It's spiritual. Paul nails it in Ephesians 6:12—our struggle isn't against the oil change or the deadline. It's against the forces trying to wear us down, make us forget who we are, and steal our drive to keep going. The enemy wants you to feel like this is all there is—just one exhausting day after another. He wants you to think you're alone in it.

But you're not. God sees every late night you've pulled, every sacrifice you've made for your family, every time you pushed through when you wanted to quit. And He's not just cheering you on—He's arming you for the fight.

## The Belt of Truth

Paul talks about the "full armor of God," and the first piece is the belt of truth. Why start there? Because truth holds everything together. When you're beat down and unmotivated, the enemy's lies hit hardest: "You're not enough." "You're failing." "Just coast—it's easier." That's when you need truth strapped on tight. Truth like: "God's strength is made perfect in my weakness" (2 Corinthians 12:9). Or: "I'm not fighting for my worth—Christ already secured it." Or: "I can keep going because God's got my back."

For me, this weekend's grind was a reminder. I was out there in the cold, hands greasy, back aching, thinking, *Why am I doing this?* Then it hit me: I'm not just winterizing a house. I'm building a home where my family feels safe. I'm not just fixing a truck. I'm making sure my wife and kids get where they need to go. Every task, every drop of sweat, is worship when it's done for God's glory. That's the truth I'm buckling on today. It's what gets me out of bed when I'd rather hit snooze.

## Your Move

So, men, what's your fight today? Maybe you're coming off a weekend like mine, where you gave it all and now you're running on fumes. Maybe it's a boss who doesn't see your effort, or a family situation that's got you stressed. Maybe it's that temptation that keeps creeping back, whispering that it's no big deal to give in just once.

Name the lie. Call it out. Then replace it with God's truth. Write it down if you have to—something real, something biblical. Mine today is: "I don't have to do this in my own strength—God's power is in me." What's yours?

And don't fight alone. Text a brother. Tell him you're feeling beat down but you're standing firm. There's power in bringing the fight into the light. The enemy thrives in the dark, but God works when we stand together.

This week isn't just about surviving. It's about fighting the right battle. You're not just a guy clocking in and out. You're a warrior, armed with God's truth, built to stand firm. So suit up. The win's already yours in Christ. Glory to Him.

**Prayer:**

Father, thank You for seeing us when we're worn out. You know every battle we face, seen and unseen. Strap Your truth on us today—remind us who we are in You. Give us strength to stand when we're drained, courage to fight when we're tempted to quit, and brothers to stand with us. Let every step we take be for Your glory. In Jesus' name, Amen.
