## Testing Video Embedding

Sometimes a video can drive home a point better than words alone. Here's how we can seamlessly integrate YouTube content into our devotionals.

{{< youtube "9UC5Ceq7CsM" >}}

### How to Use This

When you want to embed a YouTube video in any devotional, just use:

```
{{</* youtube "VIDEO_ID" */>}}
```

Where `VIDEO_ID` is the part after `watch?v=` in the YouTube URL.

For example:
- URL: `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UC5Ceq7CsM`
- Video ID: `9UC5Ceq7CsM`
- Shortcode: `{{</* youtube "9UC5Ceq7CsM" */>}}`

### Features

The video embed is:
- **Responsive** - Adapts to any screen size perfectly
- **Styled** - Matches our refined neutral design with rounded corners and shadows
- **Accessible** - Includes proper iframe attributes
- **Clean** - No YouTube branding clutter, just the video

You can add these anywhere in your devotional content—before a section, after a section, or as the main content itself.
