### **Wednesday Warrior Check-In: A Thanksgiving Tactical Briefing**

Men,

This week, you will be asked to give thanks. But for a man of faith, gratitude isn't just a polite sentiment for the dinner table; it's a strategic element of our spiritual lives.

The Apostle Paul commands us to "give thanks in all circumstances" (1 Thess. 5:18). This verse is often misunderstood. It does not mean we give thanks *for* the evil, the sin, or the trauma in our lives. We do not thank God for the existence of the wound itself. Instead, we thank Him for His presence *in* the trial, for His sovereignty *over* the chaos, and for His power to forge strength and purpose *from* the wreckage.

This Thanksgiving, we're going to practice that specific, tactical form of gratitude. This is not a journal prompt. This is a spiritual exercise.
