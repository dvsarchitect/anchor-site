Monday morning.

You woke up and immediately felt it—the weight of what's ahead. Deadlines, difficult conversations, decisions you're not sure you're ready to make. Maybe you're dreading a meeting. Maybe you're facing something at home you don't know how to handle. Maybe you're just tired and the week feels like too much before it even starts.

Here's what I'm learning: The week ahead isn't just a productivity challenge. It's spiritual warfare. And most of us show up unarmed.

Paul knew this. When he wrote to the church in Ephesus, he didn't sugarcoat it:

> "Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand. Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place..."  
> — Ephesians 6:13-14

Notice what he says: "when the day of evil comes." Not if. When.

Paul isn't talking about some distant apocalyptic battle. He's talking about Monday. Tuesday. Wednesday. The relentless daily grind where the world tries to knock you off center, where lies feel more convincing than truth, where doing the right thing costs you something.

Standing firm isn't passive. It's not just waking up and hoping for the best. It's a choice. It's active resistance against everything trying to pull you away from what you know is true.

## The Belt of Truth

The belt of truth—that's the foundation. Before anything else, you have to know what's actually true versus what culture is selling you. Truth about who God is. Truth about who you are in Christ. Truth about what actually matters when everything else is noise.

Culture says your worth is in your performance, your bank account, your status. Truth says you're a child of God, secured by Christ, and nothing can change that.

Culture says you're alone in this fight. Truth says God is with you, and He's already won the war.

Culture says compromise is survival. Truth says integrity is freedom.

## Here's the practical part

What truth are you standing on this week?

Name one. Write it down. Not some vague religious idea, but an actual biblical truth that applies to what you're facing right now.

Maybe it's: "God is faithful even when I'm afraid."  
Maybe it's: "I don't have to prove my worth—Christ already did."  
Maybe it's: "Doing the right thing matters more than being comfortable."

Whatever it is—buckle it on. Let it be the first thing you think about when Monday starts throwing punches.

Stand firm. Not because you're strong enough on your own, but because you're standing on something that can't be moved.

## Prayer

Father, thank You that we don't face this week alone. Help us to stand firm on Your truth when everything else feels shaky. Give us courage when we're afraid, clarity when we're confused, and strength when we're weak. Remind us that our identity isn't in our success or failure—it's in You. Help us put on Your armor and stand our ground today. In Jesus' name, amen.
