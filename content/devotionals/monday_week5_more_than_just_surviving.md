## Monday Mission - Week 5

The alarm goes off. The weekend is a memory. The weight of the week—the meetings, the deadlines, the pressure—settles in. The temptation on a Monday morning is just to survive. To grit your teeth and get through it.

But what if God has more for your Monday than mere survival?

Colossians 3:23-24 says, "Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men, knowing that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward. You are serving the Lord Christ."

Notice the command: "work heartily." Not half-heartedly, not grudgingly, but with your whole self. Why? Because your boss isn't your real boss. Your client isn't your real client. Your balance sheet isn't the final report. You are "serving the Lord Christ."

Your work—whether it's in a cubicle, on a job site, or in your home—is a primary place of your discipleship. It's a laboratory for faith. Every email you send, every project you manage, every conversation you have is an opportunity to either reflect the world's frantic, self-serving pace, or to embody the steady, servant-hearted strength of the King.

Your mission this Monday isn't just to check off a to-do list. It's to make your work an act of worship. To bring order out of chaos, to serve others with integrity, and to do it all for an audience of One.

Don't just survive today. Serve Him today.
